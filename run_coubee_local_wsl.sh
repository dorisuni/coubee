# Coubee Microservices Local Run Script for WSL (No GUI)
# ===================================================================
# Before you start:
# 1. Java 17 and Gradle must be installed.
# 2. Make sure script has execute permissions:
#    chmod +x run_coubee_local_wsl.sh
# ===================================================================

# Note: This script uses H2 in-memory DB and embedded services without Docker.
# It runs services in background and redirects output to log files.
